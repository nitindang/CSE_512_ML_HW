CSE 512 Machine Learning Assignments

## HW1

## HW2

Q1. MLE,MAP, Estimator Bias

Q2. Ridge Regression and LOOCV

Q3. Implement LOOCV Ridge Regression to Predict goodness points of a wine given its review


## HW3

Question 1 – Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression

Question 2 – Implementation of Logistic Regression
 Your task is to classify between hand/not-hand images.

## HW4

Question 1 – Support Vector Machines

Question 2 – Implementation of SVMs

Question 3 – SVM for object detection
 
You will train an SVM and use it for detecting human upper bodies in your favorite TV series The Big Bang Theory.


## HW5

Question 1 – Boosting

Question 2 - Programming Question (clustering with K-means)

Question 3 - You will train SVMs with different kernels and use them to classify scenes from The
Big Bang Theory, your favorite TV series. To classify an image, you will use Bag-of-Word representation,
which is one of the most popular image representation. This representation views an images as the his-
togram of image features, or visual words

## HW6

1 PCA via Successive Deflation

2 Question 2 – Action recognition with CNN

In this question, you will train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images and videos using
Pytorch. We use the UCF101 data (see http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php). 


## HW7

1 Manual calculation of one round of EM for a GMM

2 Generative Adversarial Networks (Programming)

In this section, you will train generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate images using PyTorch. We
use the MNIST data which is 60,000 training and 10,000 test images

3 Action Classification Using RNN 

In this section, you will train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to classify human actions. RNNs are de-
signed handle sequential data.
